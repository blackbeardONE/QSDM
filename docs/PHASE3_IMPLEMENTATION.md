# Phase 3 Implementation - 3D Mesh & Self-Healing

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on autonomy and security enhancements for QSDM, including 3D mesh validation, quarantines, and reputation systems.

---

## 3D Mesh Validation

### Features
- Validates transactions with 3-5 parent cells in a 3D mesh structure.
- Supports CUDA acceleration for high-performance validation.
- Fallback to CPU validation if CUDA is unavailable.

### Usage
- Transactions are validated using the Mesh3DValidator.
- CUDA acceleration is automatically used if available.

---

## Quarantine Management

### Features
- Tracks invalid transaction rates per submesh.
- Automatically quarantines submeshes exceeding invalid transaction thresholds.
- Allows manual removal of quarantine status.

### Usage
- QuarantineManager records transaction validity.
- Use IsQuarantined and RemoveQuarantine APIs to manage quarantines.

---

## Reputation System

### Features
- Manages node reputations based on stakes and penalties.
- Penalizes nodes for invalid behavior, reducing reputation scores.
- Reputation scores influence node trustworthiness.

### Usage
- Set stakes for nodes.
- Penalize nodes for misbehavior.
- Query reputation scores for decision making.

## Next Steps

- Add integration tests combining Phase 3 components.
- Prepare deployment scripts with hardware detection for CUDA.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting for quarantines and reputation changes.
