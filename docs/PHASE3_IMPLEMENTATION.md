# Phase 3 Implementation - 3D Mesh & Self-Healing

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on autonomy and security enhancements for the Quantum-Secure Dynamic Mesh Ledger (QSDM). Key components include:

- 3D Mesh Validation using Rust and CUDA for parallel validation.
- Rule-based Quarantine Management to isolate submeshes with high invalid transaction rates.
- Reputation System to penalize nodes causing invalid validations and reward good behavior.
- Manual voting mechanisms for quarantines and reputation penalties.
- Hardware optimization for 24GB RAM and GPU usage.

## Components

### 3D Mesh Validator
- Validates transactions with 3 to 5 parent cells.
- Ensures cryptographic and consensus rules are met.
- Implemented in `pkg/mesh3d/mesh3d.go`.

### Quarantine Manager
- Tracks invalid and total transactions per submesh.
- Quarantines submeshes exceeding a configurable invalid transaction threshold (default 50%).
- Sends alerts when quarantines are triggered.
- Implemented in `pkg/quarantine/quarantine.go`.

### Reputation Manager
- Maintains reputation scores for nodes.
- Penalizes nodes for invalid transactions.
- Rewards nodes for valid transactions.
- Implemented in `pkg/quarantine/reputation.go`.

### Monitoring
- Periodically logs quarantine status for operational awareness.
- Implemented in `pkg/quarantine/monitoring.go`.

## Integration
- Phase 3 components are integrated in the main node application (`cmd/qsdm/main.go`).
- Transactions are validated via 3D mesh validator.
- Quarantine and reputation systems update based on validation results.
- Monitoring runs periodically to log quarantine status.

## Usage
- Configure quarantine thresholds and reputation penalties/rewards as needed.
- Monitor logs and alerts for quarantine events.
- Use governance CLI for manual voting on quarantines and reputation penalties.

## Future Work
- Expand cryptographic validation in 3D mesh validator.
- Enhance quarantine alerting and automated responses.
- Develop comprehensive tests and benchmarks.
- Prepare deployment scripts and environment configurations.
