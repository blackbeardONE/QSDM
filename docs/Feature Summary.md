# Feature Summary of Quantum-Secure Dynamic Mesh Ledger (QSDM)

- **Quantum-Safe Cryptography:** Utilizes CRYSTALS-Dilithium for quantum-resistant digital signatures.
- **Modular Architecture:** Developed in phases with clear separation of concerns for networking, consensus, storage, and governance.
- **Proof-of-Entanglement Consensus:** Validates transactions by checking multiple parent cells, ensuring quantum-safe consensus.
- **Dynamic Submesh Management:** Supports manual creation and management of submeshes with fee thresholds, priority levels, and geographic tags.
- **WASM SDK Integration:** Enables wallet and validator modules using WebAssembly without AI dependencies.
- **Rule-Based Quarantine and Reputation System:** Isolates malicious submeshes and penalizes bad actors based on transaction validity.
- **Hardware Optimization:** Designed for mid-tier PCs with GPU acceleration (CUDA) for 3D mesh validation in later phases.
- **Efficient Storage:** Uses SQLite with Zstandard compression initially, with plans for ScyllaDB integration for high throughput.
- **Governance via Snapshot Voting:** Token-weighted voting system for manual governance of submesh rules and network parameters.
- **Transparent and Manual Governance:** Avoids black-box AI, relying on explicit rules and community voting.
- **Real-Time Web Log Viewer:** Provides monitoring and debugging capabilities through a web interface.
- **Command-Line Interfaces:** CLI tools for managing dynamic submeshes and governance voting.
- **Hardware-Agnostic Design:** Optimized for a range of hardware configurations without AI/ML dependencies.
- **Scalable and Extensible:** Designed to evolve through phases, adding scalability, self-healing, and advanced security features.

This feature set positions QSDM as a secure, scalable, and transparent decentralized ledger system resistant to quantum attacks and suitable for diverse hardware environments.
