# Phase 2 Implementation - Scalability & Optimization

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on enhancing the Quantum-Secure Dynamic Mesh Ledger (QSDM) with scalability and manual governance features. This includes dynamic submesh routing, governance voting, and WASM SDK integration.

---

## Dynamic Submesh Management

### Features
- Dynamic submeshes with priority-based routing rules.
- Manual CLI tool for adding, updating, removing, and listing submeshes.
- Routing transactions based on fee thresholds and geographic tags.

### Usage
- Use the `submeshCLI` to manage dynamic submeshes at runtime.
- Transactions are routed to appropriate submeshes based on defined rules.

---

## Governance Voting System

### Features
- Snapshot-based voting with token-weighted votes.
- CLI tool for casting votes, viewing results, and managing voting sessions.
- Voting expiry and result tallying.

### Usage
- Use the `governanceCLI` to participate in governance voting.
- Votes are weighted by token holdings to ensure fair governance.

---

## WASM SDK Integration

### Features
- WASM runtime integration using Wasmer Go SDK.
- Ability to load and execute WASM modules for wallet and validator logic.
- Example function call interface for WASM modules.

### Usage
- Load WASM modules dynamically for wallet and validator operations.
- Call exported functions such as `validate` for transaction validation.

## Next Steps

- Prepare for Phase 3 implementation focusing on 3D mesh validation, quarantines, and reputation system.
- Enhance tests and add integration tests for combined features.
- Improve documentation and user guides for CLI tools and WASM SDK usage.
