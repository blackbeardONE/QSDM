To resolve the build errors related to missing header files, please follow these steps:

1. Install Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library:
   - Download and install OQS from https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs
   - Ensure the header files (oqs/oqs.h) are located in C:\liboqs\include
   - Ensure the library files are located in C:\liboqs\lib

2. Install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit:
   - Download and install CUDA Toolkit from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
   - Ensure the header files (cuda_runtime.h) are located in C:\CUDA\include
   - Ensure the library files are located in C:\CUDA\lib\x64

3. Set environment variables in PowerShell or Command Prompt before building:
   For PowerShell:
   ```
   $env:CGO_CFLAGS="-IC:\liboqs\include -IC:\CUDA\include"
   $env:CGO_LDFLAGS="-LC:\liboqs\lib -LC:\CUDA\lib\x64"
   go build -o qsmd.exe ./cmd/qsmd
   ```

   For Command Prompt:
   ```
   set CGO_CFLAGS=-IC:\liboqs\include -IC:\CUDA\include
   set CGO_LDFLAGS=-LC:\liboqs\lib -LC:\CUDA\lib\x64
   go build -o qsmd.exe ./cmd/qsmd
   ```

4. Verify the paths and environment variables are correctly set and accessible.

If you want, I can help automate this setup or provide a Docker environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

Please confirm how you would like to proceed.
